## What the problem actually is

When a Windows user downloads `wingetscout.exe`:

1. **Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW)** — the browser tags the file as "from the internet." On first run, Windows blocks it with a SmartScreen prompt: *"Windows protected your PC."* The user has to click *More info → Run anyway*. This is the prompt we want to eliminate.

2. **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen reputation** — separate from MOTW. SmartScreen builds a reputation score per signing identity. An unsigned binary has no identity, so it has no reputation. A signed binary builds reputation as more users run it without issue.

3. **Antivirus false positives** — unsigned native AOT binaries occasionally trip heuristic AV scanners. Signing meaningfully reduces (doesn't eliminate) this.

Code signing addresses (1) immediately for **EV** certs, eventually for **OV** certs, and (2) over time for both. It can't perfectly solve (3) but helps.

## The five options

### 1. Azure Trusted Signing

Microsoft's managed cloud signing service. No hardware tokens, no certificate management — you authenticate via Entra ID, the cert lives in Azure, the build agent calls a signing endpoint. **Renamed "Azure Artifact Signing" in 2026** (same service, same pricing).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | $9.99 USD per month (Basic, ≤5,000 signatures), $99.99 per month (Premium) |
| **Cert type** | Microsoft-issued **OV** (Organization Validation). It **never issues EV** — Microsoft has stated there are no plans to. |
| **SmartScreen** | Builds reputation over time. **Not instant** (only a real EV cert is instant — see #3). |
| **Setup** | Subscription identity validation, then turnaround is fast |
| **CI integration** | First-class [`azure/trusted-signing-action`](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-signing-action) GitHub Action |
| **Eligibility (updated 2026)** | The old 3-year-org-history requirement was **dropped at GA**. Now open to **organizations** (US/Canada/EU/UK) and **individual self-employed developers** (US/Canada). Requires a **paid** Azure subscription — **no free/trial/sponsored subscriptions**. Verification documents must be <12 months old. |

**Recommendation: best fit for signed releases if a small recurring cost is acceptable.**

### 2. SignPath.io — *free for verified OSS projects*

Third-party signing service that brokers code-signing certs and runs the actual signing in their cloud. They offer a sponsored "Foundation" tier for open-source projects.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free for OSS that meets their criteria; commercial tiers from ~$10/mo |
| **Cert type** | OV via Certum / GlobalSign (publicly trusted CA) |
| **SmartScreen** | Builds reputation over time. Same warm-up as #1. |
| **Setup** | Apply, get approved (couple of weeks for OSS sponsorship), then GitHub App + project policy setup |
| **CI integration** | Their [`signpath-github-action`](https://github.com/SignPath/github-action-submit-signing-request) action |
| **Constraint** | OSS sponsorship requires project to be public, OSI-approved license, "responsible maintainership" (vague). POC projects sometimes get declined. |
| **Reputation note** | They publish a guide to building SmartScreen reputation faster — basically, ship and let users run it |

**Recommendation: apply now.** This is the first move — free, and fits the project's actual maintenance capacity. While the application is pending, keep shipping unsigned with a clear `Unblock-File` doc (see below).

### 3. EV (Extended Validation) code-signing cert + Azure Key Vault

The traditional path that **gets you instant SmartScreen reputation** — no warm-up period.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | $300–700/year (cert) + ~$10/month Azure Key Vault HSM |
| **Cert type** | EV (Extended Validation), the gold standard |
| **SmartScreen** | **Instant trust.** No warm-up. This is the *only* option that does this. |
| **Setup** | EV cert: identity verification + hardware token shipped to your physical address. Hardware token is awkward for CI. Workaround: Azure Key Vault HSM (`KEYFACTOR` signs, etc.) — pricier but cloud-signable. |
| **CI integration** | [`azuresigntool`](https://github.com/vcsjones/AzureSignTool) + `azure/login` works, OR commercial wrappers like CodeSignTool |
| **Vendors** | DigiCert, Sectigo, SSL.com, Certum |
| **Constraint** | EV cert holder must be a legal entity (individual EV is rare and pricier). Hardware token + cloud HSM combo is brittle the first time you set it up. |

**Recommendation: best fit if SmartScreen friction *now* outweighs $400–800/year.** Only choice if you absolutely cannot ship a "Unknown publisher" warning on first run.

### 4. Self-signed certificate

Don't. SmartScreen treats self-signed as unsigned (you're not in any CA's trust chain). The only thing self-signing buys you is integrity verification *if the user pre-installs your cert as a trusted root* — which no real user will do.

### 5. GitHub Attestations / Sigstore

Free, GitHub-native cryptographic provenance — proves a binary was built from a specific commit of a specific repo by a specific workflow.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free |
| **What it does** | Provenance, supply-chain trust |
| **What it doesn't do** | **It does not unblock SmartScreen.** It's not a code-signing cert. Windows doesn't check Sigstore. |
| **Worth doing?** | Yes, *in addition to* a real signing strategy. Adds verifiable build-source attestation for security-minded users. |

Documented for completeness; doesn't solve the prompt-on-download problem on its own.

## Packaging & package identity

Signing and **packaging** are separate axes, and for this project packaging matters for a second
reason beyond trust: **package identity is what lets the COM backend activate without shipping the
7 MB in-process engine.** See [com-activation.md](com-activation.md) for the full activation story
and the spike that proved it; the short version is that `0x80073D54 APPMODEL_ERROR_NO_PACKAGE` is
literally "this process has no package identity," and giving the app identity (via MSIX) clears it.

| Option | Produces | Confers package identity? | Signing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Portable exe** | one `.exe` | **No** | optional | What download A ships (CLI backend). |
| **Inno / NSIS / WiX-MSI** | classic installer → files in Program Files | **No** | sign installer + exe | A traditional installer does *not* grant identity, so it does nothing for the COM/WinRT path. |
| **MSIX** | `.msix` installed via App Installer / Store | **Yes** | **Mandatory** (cert root must be trusted on the target) | What download B ships. Gives identity → COM works. Can wrap a Native-AOT exe. |
| **Sparse / external-location package** | tiny identity `.msix` registered next to a normally-installed exe | **Yes** | **Mandatory** | Lightest way to get identity while keeping a normal install layout. Win10 19041+. |

Key facts:

- **MSIX must be signed even to *sideload*.** The signing cert's root has to be trusted on the
  target machine (a self-signed dev cert must be imported into Trusted People / a trusted root, or
  install fails with `CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT 0x800B0109`). Production wants a CA cert or Artifact
  Signing. During development, Developer Mode lets you **loose-register an unsigned layout**
  (`Add-AppxPackage -Register AppxManifest.xml`) — no cert needed — which is how the packaging
  script tests activation locally.
- **A full-trust desktop app in MSIX needs `<rescap:Capability Name="runFullTrust"/>`** in the
  manifest, and the application entry uses `EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication"`.
- **No `Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller` `<PackageDependency>` is needed** — winget's server is an
  in-box system component; you just rely on it being present (recent Win10/11; LTSC/Server SKUs may
  lack it).
- **Cost of "B" = a cert.** Production MSIX packages need a trusted signing certificate; real users need
  a signed package, so download B is gated on adopting one of options #1–#3 above (Artifact Signing
  at ~$10/mo, or SignPath OSS, being the realistic picks).

## Workaround for users on the unsigned binary (Phase 1)

PowerShell:

```powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\wingetscout.exe
```

Or right-click the exe → *Properties* → *Unblock* checkbox → *OK*. After unblocking, SmartScreen will still warn on the very first run; click *More info → Run anyway* once and it remembers.

For users who download via `gh release download`, this is a one-liner per machine.

## Release workflow signing setup

The release workflow signs and verifies MSIX packages when all seven values are configured. Add repository secrets `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and repository variables `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_PROFILE`, and `MSIX_PUBLISHER`. The publisher must match the certificate subject. A partial configuration or signing failure stops the release. Without these values, the workflow publishes portable ZIP and EXE assets but no MSIX.

The portable executables are currently unsigned even when the MSIX is signed. Artifact attestations and SHA-256 checksums are published for those assets, but neither replaces Windows code signing.
